## As a Student
I am currently a junior, majoring in **Computer Science** and minoring in **Business**.

## About Me as a Programmer
I strongly believe that:
> "Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding." Burt Rutan

Reason being that I have done the mose learning after I failed at something and looked out how I can not cause the same mistake again.


My most used pieces of code are:
```
System.out.println();
print()
print();
```
I use printing/logging constantly when debugging code.

This summer I had gone to Colorado, so here are some pictures I took while visiting. It was a great place to take a vacation as there were lots of interesting landscapes and places to hike:
