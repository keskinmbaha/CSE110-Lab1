## As a Student
I am currently a junior, majoring in **Computer Science** and minoring in **Business**.

## About Me as a Programmer
I strongly believe the following quote because I have done the most learning after I failed at something and looked out how I can not fall for the same mistake again:
> "Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding." Burt Rutan


My most used pieces of code are:
```
System.out.println();
print()
print();
```
I use printing/logging constantly when debugging code.
